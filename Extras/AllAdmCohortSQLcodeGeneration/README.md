This folder contains additional database scripts or documentation that might be helpful to sites in generating Phase 1.2 and 2.2 files for one unique cohort, "AllAdm".

4CE_PhaseX.2_CustomCohort_AllAdm_cohort_oracle_PedsPsyProject.sql -  The code in this file generates a unique cohort to capture all patients with a visit on or after Jan 1, 2019, and filter by a specific age, in this case < 25 years old. This new "AllAdm" cohort will contain all the patients admitted in your hospital. This code is an adaption of the 4CE_PhaseX.2_CustomCohorts_AllPatients_oracle.sql code.

This code has been applied in the 4CE pediatric working group. The additional folders here contain the implementation of this code across different sites (one folder per site)
